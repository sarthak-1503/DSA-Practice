 *
 * You are given a stream of records about a particular stock. Each record
 * contains a timestamp and the corresponding price of the stock at that
 * timestamp.
 *
 * Unfortunately due to the volatile nature of the stock market, the records do
 * not come in order. Even worse, some records may be incorrect. Another record
 * with the same timestamp may appear later in the stream correcting the price
 * of the previous wrong record.
 *
 * Design an algorithm that:
 *
 *
 * Updates the price of the stock at a particular timestamp, correcting the
 * price from any previous records at the timestamp.
 * Finds the latest price of the stock based on the current records. The latest
 * price is the price at the latest timestamp recorded.
 * Finds the maximum price the stock has been based on the current records.
 * Finds the minimum price the stock has been based on the current records.
 *
 *
 * Implement the StockPrice class:
 *
 *
 * StockPrice() Initializes the object with no price records.
 * void update(int timestamp, int price) Updates the price of the stock at the
 * given timestamp.
 * int current() Returns the latest price of the stock.
 * int maximum() Returns the maximum price of the stock.
 * int minimum() Returns the minimum price of the stock.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input
 * ["StockPrice", "update", "update", "current", "maximum", "update",
 * "maximum", "update", "minimum"]
 * [[], [1, 10], [2, 5], [], [], [1, 3], [], [4, 2], []]
 * Output
 * [null, null, null, 5, 10, null, 5, null, 2]
 *
 * Explanation
 * StockPrice stockPrice = new StockPrice();
 * stockPrice.update(1, 10); // Timestamps are [1] with corresponding prices
 * [10].
 * stockPrice.update(2, 5);  // Timestamps are [1,2] with corresponding prices
 * [10,5].
 * stockPrice.current();     // return 5, the latest timestamp is 2 with the
 * price being 5.
 * stockPrice.maximum();     // return 10, the maximum price is 10 at timestamp
 * 1.
 * stockPrice.update(1, 3);  // The previous timestamp 1 had the wrong price,
 * so it is updated to 3.
 * ‚Å†                         // Timestamps are [1,2] with corresponding prices
 * [3,5].
 * stockPrice.maximum();     // return 5, the maximum price is 5 after the
 * correction.
 * stockPrice.update(4, 2);  // Timestamps are [1,2,4] with corresponding
 * prices [3,5,2].
 * stockPrice.minimum();     // return 2, the minimum price is 2 at timestamp
 * 4.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= timestamp, price <= 10^9
 * At most 10^5 calls will be made in total to update, current, maximum, and
 * minimum.
 * current, maximum, and minimum will be called only after update has been
 * called at least once.
